- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RobertGcode
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in 3D Printers
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web Design
- I develop the Cyperprinter 3d printer project.

Current progress of my work *updated weekly

X2 Dual Extruder:   Working on version 2
The "X2 Universal Bowden Dual Hotend Toolhead" is a toolhead with two hotends fed by two bowden extruders with a mechanism
that lifts the second hotend mechanically. It works like an Utimaker 3 but instead of a rotational mechanism it uses a linear slider.

Cyberprintr:        Currently manufacturing first 10 batches.
The Cyberprintr TM is the first generation of my on 3d printer design. Only the best of the best components and building strategies
are being implemented. First batch will be available to order at the start of Q1 in 2022.

Cyberprintr HT:     *cancelled*
The Cyberprintr HT was supposed to be a low-cost alternative to high-end fully enclosed industrial 3d printers. The project was
cancelled due to lack of initial design planning. The concept is now being considered to be introduced to the new Hyperprintr project.

Hyperprintr:        Initial design planning
The Hyperprintr is a new 3d printer that focuses on the reliability and robustness of industrial 3d printers. 
Dual extruder, passively heated and regulated build chamber, high temp filament only, filament monitoring, part queue, minimal maintenance,
zero user experience required. These are all the design requirements. A standalone 3d printer that just prints... and prints... and prints...
